**Feature Intake Process**

All new feature ideas enter the system through the **Idea Intake Board**. Submissions must include a short description of the problem, the intended user, and a proposed outcome. Ideas without sufficient context are returned to the submitter for clarification.

During the weekly product review meeting, the team evaluates new submissions using the following criteria:

1.  Alignment with current product goals
2.  Estimated user impact
3.  Implementation complexity
4.  Dependencies on other initiatives

Ideas that pass initial review move to the **Discovery** stage. In this stage, a product owner works with engineering to validate assumptions, gather technical constraints, and outline a potential implementation approach.

If the discovery outcome is positive, the idea is promoted to the **Planned** state. At this point:

-   A high-level specification is written
-   Success metrics are defined
-   Work items are prepared for entry into the engineering backlog

Once engineering capacity becomes available, the feature is converted into formal development tasks and scheduled into an upcoming sprint.

After release, the feature enters the **Evaluation** phase. Metrics and user feedback are reviewed to determine whether the feature met its intended goals and whether follow-up improvements are needed.
